# My Dotfiles âœ¨
These are my dotfiles for my laptop (which I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) on). I'm still working on porting more configs to [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

## Structure
The `nix` folder contains two sub directories, `etcnixos` and `home-manager`. The former is the contents of `/etc/nixos` (hence the name), whereas the latter is the contents of `~/.config/home-manager`.

## What do I use?
Browser: Firefox ðŸ¦Š
Text Editor: [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)
Terminal: [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
Shell: [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
There is more that I'm using, but those are the main ones! Read my configs to get more into the specifics.
